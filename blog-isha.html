        <p class="para1">A SIP is a Systematic Investment Plan, which is offered by the mutual funds to its investors so
          that they can invest in
          a disciplined manner. In this plan the investors invest a small amount of money at regular intervals, the
          intervals can
          be as long as a few weeks, a few months, or semi-annually or annually. The fixed amount of money can be as low
          as Rs.
          500.
          SIP has been gaining popularity among Indian Mutual Fund investors, as they do not have to worry about market
          volatility
          and timing the market.

        <p class="para1">Benefits of SIP investing:

          1. One of the benefits of SIP is that it brings financial discipline to your life and a predefined amount of
          money gets
          invested automatically without any effort.
          2. With SIP, investors do not have to worry about the dynamics of the market.
          3. With investments over time, the investor would get more units when the market is low and fewer units when
          the market
          is high. This averages out the purchase cost of your mutual fund units. This in turn maximises the results.
          4. Due to point number 3, the returns will increase and the money will start compounding. This as a result
          will help the
          investors achieve their long-term financial goals.
          5. For first-time investors, it is one of the ways to invest for a long time with returns.
          6. By investing in open-ended funds one can easily withdraw the money whenever required.

          TYPES OF SIPS:
        <ol class="para1">
          <li value="1">
            <b>1. Regular SIP:</b>
            A Regular Systematic Investment Plan is the most basic plan, requiring clients to invest in Mutual Funds
            regularly,
            which can be monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. When signing up for this plan, the investor
            specifies the
            amount, frequency, and interval. However, once the sum is determined, it cannot be modified.
            This strategy is appropriate for novices or anybody who is willing to invest a predetermined amount of money
            in mutual
            funds at regular intervals and is confident in their future investment returns.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>2. Top-Up SIP:</b>

            As the portfolio value increases, investors can increase theirs periodically. It is also known as set-up
            SIP.
            This type of SIP is suitable for individuals with salary jobs or the ones that have just started working as
            it allows
            them to gradually increment the money contribution along with their salary hike.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>3. Flexible SIP:</b>
            This type of SIP lets the investor increase or decrease their investment on demand. Investors can increase
            their
            contribution when the markets are performing well and decrease it when the markets are falling. This gives
            them greater
            control over their investments.
            Individuals who are prone to financial issues or do not have a steady income source such as vegetable
            vendors, shop
            owners, start-up entrepreneurs, etc. can benefit from this type of SIP as it provides the flexibility to
            lower or
            increase the amount depending on the investor’s current financial situation.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>
              4. Perpetual SIP:
            </b>
            This does not have a fixed investment period. In simple terms, this SIP will continue until the investor
            keeps
            contributing money at regular intervals. It can only be ceased when the investor provides a stop instruction
            to the fund
            house.
            This type of SIP investment is suitable for individuals who want to invest as long as they require and then
            redeem their
            investments whenever they require them.

          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>5. Multi SIP:</b>
            This type of Systematic Investment Plan is suitable for those investors who make multiple investments in
            different funds
            for a single investment goal. Here, the investors can give a single form and payment instructions to start
            their SIP.
            This reduces the paperwork and also helps in diversifying the portfolio of the investors.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b> 6. SIP + insurance:</b>
            If an investor opts for long-duration investments then some asset management companies offer her or his
            insurance
            coverage. Insurance doesn’t affect the performance of the fund and is just an add-on feature.
            This plan is only available to equity mutual fund holders.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>7. Trigger SIP:</b>
            In the Trigger Systematic Investment Plan, if favorable market movements, an index level, or even a NAV
            level occurs
            then only the investor can invest in mutual funds.
            For instance, an investor could set up a trigger SIP to start investing only if the index level of a mutual
            fund falls
            above a particular level.
            It is advised that only individuals with a good enough understanding of the stock market use this plan as it
            requires
            knowledge and awareness about the dynamics of the stock market.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="para1">
          These days almost everything can be done online, and the same applies to SIP investment, just from the comfort
          of their
          home investors can start contributing to whichever SIP plan they prefer. Also, one may have heard of the
          mutual fund
          advertisement on television, “Mutual funds are subject to market risk…”. To avoid any big risks, one should
          take care of
          the following steps in mind.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
          Steps to start investment Mutual Funds SIP:
        <ol class="para1">
          <li>
            <b>1. Set financial goals:</b>
            Before investing, it is very important to be clear about the end goal(s) as it helps in proper planning to
            avoid any
            financial and understanding issues later during the plan as inflation causes the value of money to change.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>2. Divide the main goal into subgoals:</b>
            Now with the idea of the main goal clear in the head, one should divide it into
            subgoals with different durations to analyze the time the investments have to grow.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>3. Determine how much risk one can take:</b>
            This is one of the crucial points to consider before starting investing in any
            plan. The different SIP plans can be categorized into Low, moderately low, moderate, moderately high, and
            high risk.
            Therefore, it is vital to analyze how much risk one can take before starting a SIP in a mutual fund.
          </li>
          <hr>
          <li>
            <b>4. Seek advice from a certified professional:</b>
            Before starting investing it is very important to consult a seasoned
            professional who has ample knowledge about the stock market as their advice and knowledge would help in
            taking informed
            decisions and choosing the plan which is suitable to an individual or a group of individuals.
