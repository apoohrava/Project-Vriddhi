                  <p style="font-size:20px ;">For most of the women in India, their financial decisions early on are made by their parents, especially fathers, 
                    after marriage by their husbands. This creates issues when male members arenâ€™t around anymore. Be it, women, from urban or rural areas, 
                    lag far behind men in terms of financial independence even after having their bank accounts. As for the LGBTQ+ community, they are still 
                    misunderstood by a major section of people in India. Consequently, it leads to discrimination, and these people are not provided with equal 
                    and fair opportunities that have made them vulnerable to many things, especially employment and finances.</p>

                  <p style="font-size:20px ;"> To help these people fight this problem and help them grow stronger financially, they can help themselves and educate others as well Project 
                    Vriddhi provides them with financial education. This project falls under four UN Sustainable Development Goals i.e. Quality Education, Gender 
                    Equality, Decent work and economic growth, and Reduced inequalities. The UNAI principle that is followed is the commitment to educational opportunity 
                    for all regardless of gender, race, religion, or ethnicity as we encourage everyone to gain financial literacy and independence.</p>
